I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything.
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale,
You can take the future, even if you fail.

I believe in angels,
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale,
You can take the future, even if you fail.

Couple 222: 
I believe in angels,
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale,
You can take the future, even if you fail.
